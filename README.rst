Blowhole
=========

Blowhole is an iOS game in which the player uses an on-screen joypad to control a whale. Our faithful protagonist catches other sea creatures on his back, only to send them flying through a series of above-water rings by blowing air out of his blowhole. This is accomplished by flicking an on-screen control bar to vary the height of the blast. 

I drew all of the art for the game. It uses the cocos2d-iphone_ game framework, makes use of Box2D_ for physics, includes paralax scrolling and particle effects, and uses SneakyInput_ for the joypad.

The game hasn't worked since iOS 4.3, but maybe one of these days I (or you!) will fix that ;)
