Blowhole
=========

Blowhole is an iOS game in which the player uses an on-screen joypad to control a whale. Our faithful protagonist catches other sea creatures on his back, only to send them flying through a series of above-water rings by blowing air out of his blowhole. This is accomplished by flicking an on-screen control bar to vary the height of the blast. 

It uses the cocos2d-iphone_ game framework, Box2D_ for physics, SneakyInput_ for the joypad, and includes paralax scrolling and particle effects. I drew the art for the game using Inkscape_.

The game stopped working after iOS 4.3, but maybe one of these days I (or you!) will fix that ;)
